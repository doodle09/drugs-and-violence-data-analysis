# drugs-and-violence-data-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis project examining the relationship between drug and alcohol consumption and violent crimes across U.S. states using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This project explores how substance use, specifically drug and alcohol consumption, varies across different U.S. states and how it relates to crime rates, including assault and rape cases.

Using datasets from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System and U.S. state-level crime reports, the analysis identifies trends and correlations between substance use and violence.

**Key Insights**

States such as New Mexico, Alaska, and Nevada show both high drug and alcohol consumption and higher levels of violent crimes.
In contrast, Utah and North Dakota, where substance use is among the lowest, also report the least number of violent incidents.
However, for states with moderate consumption, the relationship between drug use and violence is not as strong, suggesting that other influences may be at play.

**Tech Stack**

Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Heatmaps, and PairGrid Visualization

**Visual Outputs**

Comparative charts showing drug and alcohol usage against crime rates
Correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships between variables
PairGrid plots highlighting trends across different U.S. states
Reports and presentations created using Power BI and Canva

**Conclusion**

The analysis shows that in states where drug and alcohol use is high, violent crime rates—such as assault and rape—are also significantly higher. Similarly, states with low substance use tend to report fewer violent incidents.

However, this pattern weakens for states in the middle range of consumption. Here, other factors such as family stability, employment opportunities, education, and law enforcement efficiency appear to influence crime levels.

This indicates that while substance use is a contributing factor to violence, it cannot alone explain variations in crime across U.S. states. A deeper understanding of social and economic contexts is essential to grasp the full picture of public safety.
